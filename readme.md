# Person Detection 

 A resnet-18 model that determines if a person is on camera. 

Please note that I have no clue what I'm doing or how any of this works, I apologize for how bad the instructions are.

## The Algorithm

A Residual Network (Resnet) is a neural network designed to be more accurate by adding shortcuts to skip some layers (note, a layer is basically stacking blocks of information), this helps build deeper network layers without the issue of vanishing gradients. 

## Running this project

1. Open a new terminal in Visual Studio, change directories into "Person-Detection/my-recognition" (cd Person-Detection/my-recognition), Run "python3 my-recognition.py (insert name of file, example 14.png)".
2. Needed Librares

-Pytorch

-Jetson-Inference
