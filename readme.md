# Person Detection 

 A resnet-18 model that determines if a person is on camera.


## The Algorithm

A Residual Network (Resnet) is a neural network designed to be more accurate by adding shortcuts to skip some layers (note, a layer is basically stacking blocks of information), this helps build deeper network layers without the issue of vanishing gradients.
